# PyNowCooing
A modern-looking Now Playing overlay for OBS, using SystemMediaTransportControl on Windows to show what you're listening to in any application.

This project is based on [NowCooing](https://github.com/victorlxyz/NowCooing), which in turn was based on [OBS-NowPlaying](https://github.com/sorachan/OBS-NowPlaying/#) by **sorachan**.

## Functionalities

- Shows the current song title, artist name, and album cover from any modern media player.  
  Tested with Spotify, Foobar2000, Apple Music and YouTube in Chrome.
- Overlay automatically resizes based on title name/artist name length.
- Single executable for Windows, no installation required.

## Usage

- Download the latest release from [Releases](https://github.com/vzsg/PyNowCooing/releases).
- Launch the executable `PyNowCooing.exe`, a console window will appear after a few seconds.
- Set up as a browser source in OBS (change the URL to what the window shows, other default settings will do).
- If you have multiple media players open, use the media controls of the Windows taskbar.  
  Click the volume icon to bring the panel up, and select the player you want to show in the overlay.

### No album cover

When the album cover is unavailable, it is hidden entirely.

## Development

To run the app from source locally:

1. Have Python installed.  
   Python 3.13.5 is known to work, older versions might work too.
2. Clone the git repository.
3. Create and activate a virtual environment per your preference.

   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. Install dependencies:

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Run the app:

   ```sh
   python PyNowCooing.py
   ```

6. Package the app with pyinstaller (optional):

   ```sh
   pip install pyinstaller
   pyinstaller --add-data "static:static" --onefile PyNowCooing.py
   ```

## Ideas for the future

- Allow theme customizations (sizing limits, marquee effect for small width, font and color changes, etc)
- Build a GUI to replace the console window and allow basic configuration (listen port, start/stop, preferred media app, etc)
- Combine the two together for a full experience.
